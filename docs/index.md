# Welcome to Metax Service Documentation

Metax is a metadata storage for Finnish research data. It's part of Fairdata Services and acts as a metadata repository for all Research Data stored in Fairdata Services.

Metax itself does not have a graphical UI, but provides an API to both Service Users (Organizations) and End Users. This documentation is meant for API users.

### About Metax API

Latest version of Metax API is V3. Documentation provided here is for Metax V3 API. Older API versions, [V1](/docs/v1/index.html) and [V2](/docs/v2/index.html), are still supported although it's *highly recommended* to use V3.

### Fairdata Services and Tools

In addition to Metax API, you can use other Fairdata Services and Tools to manage your data and metadata in more graphical way.
