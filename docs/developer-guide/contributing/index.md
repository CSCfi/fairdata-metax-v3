# Contributing

Before contributing, check you have your development setup in order. Following steps describe general development workflow when working with Metax

## Write the implementation

Write easy to understand code with descriptive class, function and variable names. Use Black formatter to format your code and `isort` to organize imports.

## Write unit-tests

Test your implementation with unit-tests and manual testing

## Write documentation

Write [Google-styled docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for your classes and functions. Add any written classes, functions and tests to MkDocs. Update readme if necessary.
