# Contributing

This part of the documentation introduces the Metax project structure and its most relevant features, development-wise.

Metax source code is publicly available, and can be improved by anyone. The [GitHub repository of the project](https://github.com/CSCfi/fairdata-metax-v3), which is updated after every service break, is a mirror of a Fairdata internal repository, which is used for the bulk of Metax development. External contributions are accepted through GitHub, according to [contributions policy](./policy.md). Start developing by familiarizing yourself with it and the code [on GitHub](https://github.com/CSCfi/fairdata-metax-v3). A description of the project structure is also available in [Project Structure](./project-structure/index.md).

Instructions for installation, database and cache container setup, and (optional) connection to local Metax V1-V2 are all documented in the repository README. Remember to also check [useful external documentation](./external-docs.md) to get familiar with the frameworks that are in use.

This documentation is an introduction to how Metax project handles [dependencies](./dependencies.md), [authentication](token-authentication.md), and [caching](caching.md). Good [testing and documentation](testing-and-documentation.md) practices are also explained.
