# Contributions Policy

## When implementing

* Write easy to understand code with descriptive class, function and variable names
* Use black formatter to format your code: `black src`
* Use `isort` to organize imports
* Write [unit tests and documentation](./testing-and-documentation.md), test also manually

## When implementation is ready

* Run unit tests: `pytest`, and make sure they all pass
* Create [a pull request on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
* [Fairdata](https://www.fairdata.fi/)-developers periodically check pull requests on GitHub and test them; comments and suggestions will be added to the pull request by Fairdata-developers
* After the required improvements have been implemented, the pull request can be accepted
* Fairdata-developers handle the merging of the feature branch to the master branch internally
