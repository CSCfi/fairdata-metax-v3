# Metax Datamodel and DCAT 3

Metax is fully compatible with DCAT 3 data-model, but has some minor variations allowed by the specification. This article will explain how DCAT is integrated into Metax V3 data-model. 

!!! NOTE
    This comparison is comparing DCAT concepts to equivalent Metax database Models. V3 classes have Django application name in front of them. 

!!! WARNING
    This article does not compare API-endpoint responses to DCAT. This will be done later.

## DCAT classes

This comparison is comparing DCAT concepts to equivalent Metax database Models. V3 classes have Django application name in front of them.
